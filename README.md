# Retail-Price-Optimization

Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to estimate prices for different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are pretty sensitive to their costs, and as such, a slight change in their price can lead to a noticeable difference in their sales. At the same time, there are also products whose sales are not much affected by their worth - these tend to be luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). 
Depending on whether you are interested in increasing your business’s profit/footfall/overall revenue/sales, you can choose to try the following price optimization methods: cost-less pricing, competition-based pricing, perceived-value pricing, demand-based pricing, etc. 
Price Optimization can be achieved using regression machine learning algorithms like linear regression. One can first estimate the price elasticity for each product using the past sales data and then use the coefficient for price optimization.
